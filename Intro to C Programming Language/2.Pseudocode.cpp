/*
# Question 1

Write a program that obtains two integer numbers from the
user. It will print out the sum of those numbers.

START
Insert First Integer
Insert Second Integer
Calculate Sum of Two Input
Display result output explanation
Display result output
END

# Question 2

Finding average of any three numbers.

We might usually specify the procedure of solving this
problem as “add the three numbers and divide by
three”. Here, Read (or Ask) and Write (or Say) are
implied. However in an algorithm, these steps have to
be made explicit. Thus a possible algorithm is:

START
Read values of X, Y, Z
S = X + Y + Z
A = S / 3
Write value of A
END

# Question 3

Finding square and cube.

START
Read The value of N
S = N * N
C = S * N
Write value of S, C
END

# Question 4

Finding biggest of two numbers.

START
Read A, B
If A>B, then BIG = A, otherwise BIG = B
Write BIG
END

# Question 5

Calculate pay

START
Input hours
Input rate
Pay = hours * rate
Print pay
END

# Exercise :

Write a Pseudocode for these problems.

1. S = (A + B + C) / Y

          START
          Input = A, B, C, Y
          S = (A + B + C)/Y
          Print S Output
          END

2. Convert from Celsius to Fahrenheit.
      (Multiply by 9, then divide by 5, then add 32 )
      
          START
          Input = Celcius
          Fahrenheit = (Celcius * 9)/5 + 32
          Print Fahrenheit Output
          END

3. Area of Circle (pie r 2)

          START
          Insert = r value
          Area_of_circle/pie = 3.14 * (r * 2) //Area of circle formula (pie r2)
          Print Area_of_circle/pie Output
          END

4. Volume of Sphere (4/3 pie r 3)

          START
          Insert = r value
          Area_of_circle/pie = 3.14 * (r * 3) //Volume of sphere formula (4/3 pie r3)
          Volume_of_sphere = 4/3 * Area_of_circle/pie
          Print Volume_of_sphere Output
          END

5. Average speed = Distance traveled/Time taken

          START
          Input = Distance traveled
          Input = Time taken
          Speed = Distance traveled/Time taken
          Print Speed Output
          END
