/* A flowchart is a graphical representation of an
algorithm.
• These flowcharts play a vital role in the programming
of a problem and are quite helpful in understanding
the logic of complicated and lengthy problems.
• Once the flowchart is drawn, it becomes easy to
write the program in any high level language. */
